# Some design principles from the Funsor project
## 2021-03-02

### Build magical things.

cite: neural tangent kernel
cite: programming with infinite sets
cite: calculus of bag relations https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10503
cite: Yayoi Kusama's mirror rooms
cite: rational keyboard
cite: Shepard scale

### Diversify interpretations.

### Make one thing work, then make a few things work, then report what doesn't work.

in particular, aim for imperfection and a longer range theorem

### Make the debugging experience pleasant.

- pretty printing
- logging

### Draw from a broad range of tools, but don't overly rely on any one.

- operator overloading
- class hierarchies
- multiple dispatch / pattern matching
- term rewriting
- memoization
- pure functional programming & immutability
- monte carlo sampling
- numpy-style array programming

### Aim for monolithic functions with simple behavior.

cite: pyro models (plate vs map)

### Immutability

cite: jax
cite: haskell, clojure
