# The Rational Keyboard
## 2012-01-08

While traveling in Vietnam, I wrote a little browser app to experiment with automated reasoning about harmony in just intonation.
The resulting [Rational Keyboard](http://fritzo.org/keys) is kind of like a piano whose keys move around to make consonant notes & chords easy to play.
One cool thing about an instrument with moving keys is that it can access all rational tones (a dense infinite set) with only a finite number of keys visible at any time.

If you'd like to see how it works, or help getting it working in other browsers, check out the [github page](https://github.com/fritzo/rationalkeyboard) or just

```bash
git clone git@github.com:fritzo/rationalkeyboard.git
```
